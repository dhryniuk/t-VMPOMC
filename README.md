## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Julia
   - MPI
   - Required Julia packages (as specified in `Project.toml`)

2. **Running an Example:**  
   To run an example simulation for a spin chain with drive, long-ranged competing Ising interactions and incoherent decay, execute:
   ```sh
   julia spin_chain_demo.jl

   Refer to the comments in the file above for further explanation on simulation setup, key functions, and (hyper)parameters.
